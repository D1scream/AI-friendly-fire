In America people use automobile for everyday life. Look at it this way, if there weren't any car any more we would be walking all the time. Which would LEED to bad joint pain and expensive doctor bill. Plus think of how crowded the side walk would be. Your kids would get lost or even stolen right out from under your none now do you really want that. Automobile have been around forever why ruin what people worked Jo hard to gain. A lot of people would love their job if we got rid of them. You think the unemployment wait IJ bad now get rid of car and watch it increase.

If we had to walk everywhere, that pain that just went away in your ankle and feet would suddenly come back again. And what if you're in a hurry to get to work how are you going to get there in time if your only going at a walking speed. The crowd would low you down evenly, even at school the crowd can low a person down by a lot. When the teacher let up out early I don't have to fight the crowd AJ much and can get to my parent much faster to go home.

Think about the children, if you were walking one day to the store and look back to see that your five-year-old IJ suddenly mining, what would you do. You would look and see nothing but people in the crowd, you would have no clue to who is a haj your child. But if you're in your car, and you look back he/the will be right there safe and found waiting to get home to watch there favorite show, not in the hand of a stranger wondering who IJ this person and will I ever see my mommy again.

We American work hard for what we get in life, and if you get laid off from your job what gone through your head. Well I don't personal have a job, but you do, and Jo do hundred of people at Ford Motor Company, and General Motor two very famous automobile manufacturer. If we don't drive car and buy car guest what happen they love money and if a huge manufacture love money then it time to start lowering wage and laying people off. So do you really want that.

So think before you do things like take away our car right. The prompt Jay to find good things about not having car but I just can't because the bad IJ more bad than the good IJ good. Personal if I had a child I wouldn't want him/her being stolen by a stranger. Or being me being laid off because people don't what to harm the earth'j atmosphere.
