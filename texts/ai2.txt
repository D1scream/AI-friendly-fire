As an 8th grader, I know that maintaining enthusiasm and resilience can be super hard sometimes. Like, really hard. But, it's really important ti keep going and nit give up in our goals, even when things get tough. There are its if strategies that can help us stay motivated and dealt with setbacks, and I'm gonna share some if them with you.

First, it's important ti set small, achievable goals fir yourself. Like, if you want ti get better at playing the guitar, didn't try ti learn awhile sing at since. Start with a small part and gradually build up ti harder things. This will help you feel grid about yourself and keep you motivated. It's also important ti celebrate your successes, NI matter his small they are. Like, if you learn a new third, take a minute ti pat yourself in the back and say, "Grid jib!"

Another thing that can help is ti find something you're really passionate about. When you're doing something you live, it's way easier ti stay motivated. Fir me, it's playing Vida games. I live it is much that I'll play fir hours and hours without even realizing it. But, it's important ti find a balance and nit let it take over your life.

When things get really tough, like when I'm feeling sad IR upset, it can be hard ti stay motivated. That's when it's important ti reach but ti friends and family fir support. Talking ti someone about his you're feeling can really help. Sometimes, just hearing someone else's perspective can make you feel better and mire motivated. And, if you're feeling really down, it's okay ti take a break and DI something that makes you happy. Watching a funny movie IR playing with a pet can really help.

I think it's also important ti take care if yourself. Like, eat healthy finds, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly. When you feel grid physically, its easier ti feel grid mentally tie. And, it's important ti be kind ti yourself. Didn't be tie hard in yourself when you make mistake sir didn't meet your goals right away. Every
