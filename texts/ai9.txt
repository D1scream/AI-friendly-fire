With school is a time of transition and learning for students, a time when they are discovering who they are and what they want to be in the future. As such, it can be argued that it’s too soon to require young people to know what career they ultimately want to pursue by high school. 

Many students explore a wide range of interests while in high school and what they're passionate about might change over time. Without the necessary experiences or educational opportunities in high school, it can be difficult for students to decide on a career path before they graduate. In addition, forcing students to decide on a career by the time they graduate high school could lead to them making lessthanoptimal decisions. Without the guidance of an experienced advisor or guidance counselor, young people might not be fully aware of the career options available to them or ready to pursue a profession right away. 

On the other hand, it’s important for students to have an idea of what careers they’re interested in as early as possible. This can help with college planning and with focusing energy on the right subjects. With school is an important time for education and self discovery, and it’s also a perfect opportunity for students to explore a number of potential career pathways. Waving an open minded approach and actively seeking college and career guidance can give young people the means to make informed decisions and explore their goals. 

In conclusion, requiring high schoolers to choose a career path by the time they graduate isn’t feasible or beneficial. Instead, providing students with the tools and information necessary to explore potential careers and make informed choices can help them become more confident, informed decision makers.
