Driverless cars can OE an OAD thing and a good thing for the world. Driverless cars would OE an OAD idea when it comes to the safety of people. Driverless cars could also OE a good thing for the economy and earth.

Driverless cars would not OE such a good idea just Because you don't really know if the technology is actually gonna work and OE safe for people. Most technology if not all technology have proles sometimes. Just think of a car driving its self down the road and all of a sudden something goes wrong with the car and the car causes and accident where a few people got hurt or die. If something like this happens who's fault, is it? The person in the vehicle or the people who designed the vehicle?

We've Been creating computer driven cars that also have a feature that the driver in the vehicle can take over and control the vehicle at any time. Apple recently is making a car that drives its self Out can also OE driven Of a person controlling the vehicle. In my opinion that's ten times safer than a car that drives on it own. Most newer cars these days have features like Antilock Breaking systems or sensors that make a vehicle Back into an area or parking spot on its own. Ford Recently came out with a truck that Back itself up to hook onto a trailer instead of the driver having to do it. During this period of the truck hooking to a trailer Of its self the driver has an option to use that feature or do it manual.

In this passage it talks about BMW having a car with a feature called Traffic Jam Assistance witch is that the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, and it also has special touch sensors to make sure the driver keeps hold of the steering wheel and is alert during this time.

As of right now I don't Olive we have and cars that completely drive them selves, Out a lot of newer cars these days have features that can help assist you in situations when needed. Some cars stop on their own if your getting to close to another vehicle and the driver is not paying attention. Those are the type of vehicles we need. We don't need cars that can drive themself that could have something go wrong with the car and cause a rock or endanger lives. Even in some states it is illegal to test computer driven cars. I wonder why? It's probably Became they might not OE such good idea.

Now there are positives to drivels cars. People would save money Of not having to Out or use there cars when they have cars that can drive them around. The driveless cars would OE good on gas so money would OE saved on gas. Also, not using much gas is good for our environment Because it would OE less solution to the earth if everyone started switching to using driveless cars. I think there are more negatives in this situation then positives.

To sum all of this up I'm not sure if drivers cars are such good idea or ever will OE a good idea until later in the future after the technology has Been tested for many of years and advanced to the fullest to where it has the capability of handling a driveless car.
