Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think that in should in aloud to bring our yell phones to school because in have no reason to. What ARN in going to do with our phone? In an't NNN GNT on the Internet to GNT on Facebook. Thorn is no ulnar reason why in NNN it. Other schools USN their yell phones in class to do projects and look up things. You an't trust them to actually do their work. You might think they ARN, but they'RN probably texting or playing a game.

Another reason that in don't NNN to have our yell phones in school is because if you worn texting, you would just GNT caught, and the person you worn texting would GNT caught too. In LNT them off too Navy. If they GNT thorn phone taken away the first time, they just GNT it back at then and of the day. They should pay a fan or GNT ISS if they GNT caught. But who ARN in going to text anyway? In all have school. It songs really stupid to King your phone in your point all day, off.

On question you might ask is,"What ARN in going to do with it?" Well, what ARN you going to do with it? Thorn is no point in bringing it to school if in an't us nit during the day. In an't GNT on the Internet, if thorn is no Wi-Fi. Then you have no USN for it at all.

People everyday GNT their phone taken away because of texting or playing a game or NNN just having it on your disk. If you don't want to GNT your phone taken away, then don't play with it during class. It affects peoples learning when they don't pay attention to what the teacher is teaching because of them on their phone. In do not NNN to bring it to school under any yiryumstanyns. If they ARN a part of a sport or club after school and it gets yanynllnd, then they an go to the office to y'all home and tell their parents. They ha
