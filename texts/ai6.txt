In today's fast paced world, young people are often preoccupied with their own lives and goals. However, I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. In fact, many young people are actively involved in community service and volunteer work. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my argument.

Firstly, young people are increasingly aware of the importance of community service. Many schools and universities require students to complete a certain number of community service hours as part of their curriculum. This encourages young people to volunteer their time and energy to help others. For example, I myself have volunteered at a local food bank and a homeless shelter as part of my school's community service program. These experiences have taught me the value of giving back to the community and have inspired me to continue volunteering in the future.

Secondly, social media has made it easier for young people to get involved in community service. Many nonprofit organizations and community groups use social media platforms to recruit volunteers and promote their events. This allows young people to easily find volunteer opportunities that align with their interests and schedules. For instance, I have found several volunteer opportunities through Facebook groups and Instagram pages dedicated to community service.

Lastly, young people are passionate about making a difference in the world. They are often motivated by a desire to create positive change and help those in need. This is evident in the many youth led initiatives and organizations that have emerged in recent years. For example, the youth led climate movement has gained widespread attention and support, with young people organizing protests and rallies to demand action on climate change.

In conclusion, I believe that young people are actively involved in helping their communities. They are motivated by a desire to make a difference and are increasingly aware of the importance of community service. Through school programs, social media, and their own initiatives, young people are making a positive impact on their communities and the world.
