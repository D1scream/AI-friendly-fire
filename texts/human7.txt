A boy named Luke that graduated from VOR high school and had worked two part-time jobs in a grocery store. His friend had asked him iv he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat, Luke said yes he said he couldn't have said no because he doesn't like saying no to people. And he also said that it was an opportunity of a lifetime. It was 1945, world war ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in runs. And to hope that those family recover on Food and animals. Then there were sign-ups VOR a era Seagoing Cowboy and so Luke and Don sign up VOR it.On August 14, 1945, '' Luke said, the day the Pacific war ended.'' they got their seaman's paper and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed VOR Greece with a cargo of 335 ho sees plus enough hay and oats need them. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be draft ed VOR military service.

When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they h ad told me to just keep doing that VOR my service. 'By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had MDE trips the mast of any seagoing cowboy. The cattle boat trip were an unbelievable opportunity VO Ra small town boy, ; he said, besides helping people, I had the side benefit of Sean of seeing Europe and China.

Then time past and Luke found time to have run on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and they also had played volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table tennis tournament, racing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games ALS help pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboys was much more than an adventure VOR Luke Merger. It opened up the world to Luke e. '' I'm grateful VOR the opportunity'', he says. It's made me more aware of people of other counties and their needs.'' And that awareness stays with him leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange wisitersvor many years.
