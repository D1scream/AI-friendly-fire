She attend to Generic_School as a new students doing HLR first day she didn't learn nothing all. Because HLR classmates was too busy missing around. After she go home talk to HLR family and parents, so their decide to make HLR stay home take HLR classes online, so she won't have to listen to HLR classmates missing around anymore for now on she got time to study and focus at the SAML time without anybody disturb HLR.

Has a students you taking online classes you could work in your own private space. For example, Generic_Name was a very kind person. HL doesn't like a lot noise, so doing his first lessons HL found like a private room HL could go to take his class at his house without no on interrupt him. Generic_Name thought it was fantasy to later the room sit down in a chair in front of his laptop, put on his headphone and started watching his professor give him the lessons. Also, without listen to others tell him to do something HL's not supposed to do.

Has a students taking online classes you got more time to relaxing such as taking Carl your personal business also. For example, Generic_Name is taking night classes. His classes will started at 10:00 PM HL doesn't LLD to GLT up like other students to. For instances, if Generic_Name working day time. At dollar general HL will started around 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. Basically HL will have time come home and chill out, and started his classes.
