Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Rear Mentor [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has its advantages and should be retained.

One of the strengths of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the presidential election. As stated in "In Defense of the Electoral College" by Judge Richard A. Poster, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the election results are more decisive and less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. In instances where there is a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, the election is thrown to the House of Representatives, ensuring that a clear winner is determined.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is representative of all regions of the country. As Judge Poster explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign in different states, rather than focusing solely on populous areas. This way, candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters and address the concerns of various regions. This keeps the president accountable to the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few heavily populated areas.

The system of swing states, which is inherent in the Electoral College, also has its advantages. In "In Defense of the Electoral College," Judge Poster argues that the winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on closely contested states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more informed and engaged in the election process. These swing states often represent a diverse cross section of the population, ensuring that the president is responsive to a wide range of viewpoints and concerns.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. Judge Poster explains that the apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states less political weight. By awarding electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College gives larger states more attention in presidential campaigns. This ensures that the interests and concerns of both large and small states are taken into account during elections.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, as explained by Judge Poster. This prevents complications and delays in the election process. It also ensures that a clear winner is determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps maintain confidence in the election results and prevents prolonged political uncertainty.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College system, such as the argument that it may discourage some voters in "sure win" states from participating, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides stability, representation, and accountability in the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College when considering any potential changes to the presidential election system. It is clear that this system has its merits and has served our country well for centuries. I believe that preserving the Electoral College will uphold the principles on which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I look forward to your continued dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,
