Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the fairest and most democratic way to choose our nation's leader.

The Electoral College is a system that gives disproportionate power to the votes of people in small states. In 2016, for example, Pillar Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes, but she lost the election to Donald Trump because he won more electoral votes. This is because the Electoral College awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state, even if the candidate wins the popular vote by only a small margin. This means that a candidate can win the presidency without winning the support of a majority of the American people.

I believe that the Electoral College is undemocratic and unfair. It gives more power to the votes of people in small states than to the votes of people in large states. This is because a candidate can win the electoral votes of a small state with a relatively small number of votes. For example, in 2016, Trump won the electoral votes of Wyoming with just 146,148 votes. This is despite the fact that California, with a population of over 39 million people, has the same number of electoral votes as Wyoming.

I also believe that the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few "swing" states. This is because candidates know that they can win the presidency by winning the electoral votes of a few key states, even if they lose the popular vote nationwide. This means that candidates often ignore the needs of the people in states that are considered to be "safe" for one party or the other.

I believe that electing the President by popular vote would be more democratic and fair. It would give every American voter an equal voice in the election. It would also encourage candidates to campaign in all parts of the country, not just in a few swing states.

I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be a major step forward for American democracy.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
