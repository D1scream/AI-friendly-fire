In the world of machine learning and deep learning, we’ve made significant strides in handling data with fixed input and output sizes. Traditional neural networks, like feedforward and convolutional neural networks, excel at tasks where inputs and outputs are of a predetermined size, such as image classification. However, they fall short when dealing with sequential data or data with varying input and output lengths.
Imagine trying to generate a coherent sentence. In any language, sentences aren’t just random words thrown together; they follow grammatical rules and convey specific meanings. To generate meaningful sentences, a model needs to understand the sequence and context of words. This is where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) come into play.
RNNs are designed to handle sequential data by taking the output from previous steps and using it as input for the current step. They are essential for tasks that involve time series data or any data where the order matters.
